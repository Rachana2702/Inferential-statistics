# Inferential-statistics
## Overview
This project involves statistical analysis and hypothesis testing on two distinct datasets to answer specific research questions related to player injuries, gunny bag breaking strength, and dental implant hardness. The primary goal is to calculate probabilities, conduct hypothesis tests, and draw meaningful conclusions from the data provided.

## Dataset 1: Player Injuries and Gunny Bags
The first part of the project focuses on two key areas:

Player Injuries: Calculating probabilities related to player positions, types of injuries, and injury likelihood based on player position.

Gunny Bags Breaking Strength: Assessing the proportion of gunny bags that have a breaking strength within specific ranges, using probability calculations.

Dataset 2: Dental Implants Hardness

The second part of the project is centered on a more advanced statistical analysis of dental implant hardness, including:

Hypothesis Testing on Stone Hardness: Conducting tests to compare the hardness of polished and unpolished stones and determining if there is a significant difference.

Dental Implants: Analyzing how implant hardness varies based on different dentists and methods used, including interaction effects between dentist and method, and analyzing both types of alloys separately.

## Key Analytical Techniques:
Probability Calculations: Basic probability is used to answer questions related to injury likelihood and breaking strength proportions.
Hypothesis Testing: Includes formulating null and alternative hypotheses, checking assumptions, calculating p-values, and drawing conclusions on the difference in hardness across dentists and methods.
Interaction Effects: Interaction plots and their inferences are used to understand the effect of dentists and methods on implant hardness.




## Conclusion:
For Alloy 1, both the fabrication method and the dentist significantly influence the hardness of dental implants, with a notable interaction effect between them. However, for Alloy 2, only the method impacts implant hardness, and neither the dentist nor the interaction between method and dentist is significant. This insight is crucial for optimizing manufacturing practices to ensure consistent implant hardness and reliability.

## Recommendations:
For Football Teams:

Implement tailored training and injury prevention for strikers due to their higher injury risk.
Focus on injury management strategies for forwards and wingers.

For Quality Assurance in Packaging:

Enhance quality control measures to reduce the proportion of gunny bags with breaking strengths below 3.17 kg/cm².
Ensure consistent production of gunny bags with strengths above 3.6 kg/cm².

For Printing Services:

Use polished stones for printing due to their higher hardness.
Investigate ways to improve the hardness of unpolished stones if their use is necessary.

For Dental Implants:

Review and standardize implant fabrication methods, particularly Method 3, which shows inconsistencies.
Provide additional training or standardization for dentists to maintain consistent implant hardness across different methods.
Conduct further research to reduce implant hardness variability related to the interaction between dentists and methods.
